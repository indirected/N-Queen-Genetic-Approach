# N-Queen Genetic Approach
a genetic algorithm approach to solving the n-queen problem.

## Usage
The hyper-parameters for the algorithm are set through the `infile` file in this format:
```
population size
chromosome lenght (N)
maximum no. of generations.
crossover probability
mutation probability 
output file name
```
then you can run the program and you should provide only one argument: the name of the input file.

The algorithm's progress and the final solution is printed into the output file. the solution is printed both in a list format and a chess board visualization.


A comprehensive report of the project, including problem definition, used selection, mutation and crossover mechanisms, results and sample solutions to **500-Queen and 1000-Queen Problems** found by this algorithm are available in the pdf file. for more information, refer to the report file.
